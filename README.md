# EMI-loan-calculator
This project is made to calculate the loan's emi based on the pre-specified parameters.
EMI Calculator (Python)
This project is a simple EMI (Equated Monthly Instalment) calculator made using basic Python programming concepts. The program uses only simple tools like functions, lists, loops, and normal arithmetic operations. No external libraries are needed.

Problem Definition
Many people take loans for things like education, home, or personal needs, but they do not always understand how the monthly EMI is calculated. This program tries to solve that problem by giving a clear and simple way to calculate EMI, total payment, and total interest.

Requirement Analysis
The program should be able to:
•	take the loan principal amount
•	take the annual interest rate
•	take the loan duration in years
•	calculate the EMI
•	calculate the total amount paid
•	calculate the total interest paid
•	print a clear report for each loan

Top-Down Design / Modularization
The program when modularized includes:
1.	A function to calculate EMI
2.	A function to calculate total payment
3.	A function to calculate total interest
4.	A function to print the loan report
5.	Lists for storing multiple loans
6.	A loop to process every loan one by one
This makes the program cleaner and easier to manage.



Algorithm Development (Short Explanation)
1.	Start
2.	Read principal, interest rate, and duration
3.	Convert annual rate to monthly rate
4.	Convert years to number of months
5.	Apply the EMI formula
6.	Calculate total payment
7.	Calculate total interest
8.	Print the results
9.	Repeat for next loan
10.	End

Implementation
The project is created using:
•	functions
•	lists
•	simple mathematical expressions
•	basic print statements
•	a for-loop
•	
Testing and Refinement
The code was tested using:
•	different principal amounts
•	different interest rates (including zero percent)
•	different loan durations
•	several borrowers in a list

Expected Outcome
This program helps the user:
•	understand how EMI is calculated
•	check total payment and total interest
•	compare different loan options
The code is easy to extend if more features are needed in the future.
